# Water Cycle

This is my implementation of a water cycle "simulator" for NCSU ES 150.

This project is built using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

To install it it, first install poetry, clone this repository, and then run `poetry install` from the
project's root directory. The program will be available as `water-cycle` from the root directory.
