        The Earth's atmosphere covers the entire globe. Water is present in it
        as water vapor, which can condense to form clouds, some of which emit
        rain or become thunderstorms. The water in the Earth's atmosphere
        primarily comes from the evaporation of ocean water, and it mostly
        falls back to the ocean as rain.
    - name: Surface ocean
      amount: 130000
      variance: 30
      description: |
        The oceans are the Earth's largest reservoir of water. Oceans cover
        71% of the Earth's surface and contain 96.5% of Earth's water.
        The ocean functions as an important carbon sink and currents in
        the ocean help to regulate the temperature on the Earth's surface.
        The ocean's surface is considered separate from the lower levels as it
        is directly fed by land surface water flows and rain, and it can directly 
        evaporate into the atmosphere. The ocean's surface is generally warmer,
        more well-lit, and saltier than deeper waters.
    - name: Deep ocean

        The ocean functions as an important carbon sink and currents in
        the ocean help to regulate the temperature on the Earth's surface.
        The deep ocean is generally colder, darker, and less salty than
        surface waters. Because of the salinity and temperature gradient, 
        surface and deep waters don't mix very much relative to the amount
        of water present in both regions.

      description: |
        Oceanic evaporation occurs when water changes phase from liquid to
        water vapor at the ocean's surface. This change is primarily driven
        by thermal energy delivered to the ocean's surface by the sun. Ocean
        evaporation is the primary influx of water into the Earth's atmosphere,
        and is a big factor in coastal weather patterns.
    - name: Ocean precipitation
      amount: 380.0
      variance: 20.0
      source: Atmosphere over ocean
      destination: Surface ocean
      description: |
        Most of the precipitation that falls on Earth falls over the ocean.
        Ocean precipitation accounts for over three quarters of all precipitation
        on earth.

        The flow of water from the ocean's surface to its deeper reaches is called
        vertical ocean circulation.
