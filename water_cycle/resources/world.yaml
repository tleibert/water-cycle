    - name: Atmosphere over ocean
      amount: 10
      variance: 20
      description: |
        The Earth's atmosphere covers the entire globe. Water is present in it
        as water vapor, which can condense to form clouds, some of which emit
        rain or become thunderstorms. The water in the Earth's atmosphere
        primarily comes from the evaporation of ocean water, and it mostly
        falls back to the ocean as rain.
    - name: Surface ocean
      amount: 130000
      variance: 30
      description: |
        The oceans are the Earth's largest reservoir of water. Oceans cover
        71% of the Earth's surface and contain 96.5% of Earth's water.
        The ocean functions as an important carbon sink and currents in
        the ocean help to regulate the temperature on the Earth's surface.
        The ocean's surface is considered separate from the lower levels as it
        is directly fed by land surface water flows and rain, and it can directly 
        evaporate into the atmosphere. The ocean's surface is generally warmer,
        more well-lit, and saltier than deeper waters.
    - name: Deep ocean
      amount: 1200000.0
      variance: 8.0
      description: |
        The oceans are the Earth's largest reservoir of water. Oceans cover
        71% of the Earth's surface and contain 96.5% of Earth's water.
        The ocean functions as an important carbon sink and currents in
        the ocean help to regulate the temperature on the Earth's surface.
        The deep ocean is generally colder, darker, and less salty than
        surface waters. Because of the salinity and temperature gradient, 
        surface and deep waters tend to stratify, or separate into layers.
    - name: Ice sheets and glaciers
      amount: 26000.0
      variance: 10.0
      description: |
        Most of the earth's fresh water (only about 3% of all water) is present in
        ice sheets and glaciers. They play an important role in the global climate,
        by reflecting the sun's energy back into space instead of absorbing it.
        Melting glaciers and ice sheets release fresh water, either into the ocean
        or into rivers and streams, depending on their location.
    - name: Snowpack
      amount: 2.7
      variance: 20.0
      description: |
        Snowpack forms as snow falls and accumulates in regions and elevations where
        the temperature is cold for extended periods of the year. Snowpacks are a very
        important water resource, as they steadily release fresh water into rivers and
        streams as they melt, providing drinking water and water for agriculture. For
        example, the rivers that feed California's central valley are fed by the snowpack
        that accumulates in the adjacent mountains, like the Sierra Nevada. As the
        climate warms up in these colder regions, less snowpack will accumulate, meaning
        less fresh water will be available later in the year.
    - name: Permafrost
      amount: 210.0
      variance: 100.0
      description: |
        Permafrost is ground that remains frozen year-round. It is primarily found in northern
        latitudes, being widespread in the arctic regions of Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, to name
        a few places. The permafrost in this region covers up thousands of years' worth of 
        deceased organisms, comprising a massive store of carbon-containing compounds. As the
        permafrost melts, these greenhouse gases, like methane, are released into the atmosphere.
    - name: Atmosphere over land
      amount: 3.0
      variance: 10.0
      description: |
        Water in the atmosphere over the Earth's land primarily comes from ocean evaporation.
        The circulation of moisture-laden air from the ocean to land is one of the main
        contributing factors to the Earth's weather patterns. Chances are, whenever rain
        falls in your area, that water started its trip from the ocean's surface.
    - name: Fresh lakes
      amount: 110.0
      variance: 20.0
      description: |
        Rain and snowmelt feed streams and rivers, which can accumulate into freshwater lakes.
        Freshwater lakes are an important resource for humans, plants, and animals alike.
        Natural lakes provide important habitat, drinking water, and recreation. They also
        serve to moderate large rainfalls and control flooding.
    - name: Reservoirs
      amount: 11.0
      variance: 40.0
      description: |
        Reservoirs are essentially man-made lakes. They're primarily constructed to store
        water for human use, provide power via hydroelectric dams, and control rainwater.
        They can also provide similar recreation and habitat to naturally occurring lakes.
    - name: Rivers
      amount: 1.9
      variance: 20.0
      description: |
        Rivers are formed as precipitation in a given watershed collects into a series
        of streams. Streams eventually combine to form larger and larger flows, including
        rivers. Rivers provide important habitat for animals and plants, water for human use,
        and are useful for transportation as well. Rivers eventually terminate by flowing
        into the ocean.
    - name: Wetlands
      amount: 14.0
      variance: 20.0
      description: |
        Wetlands are broadly described as areas where water covers or is present near the
        surface of the soil. Included in this definition are marshes, bogs, swamps, mires,
        and many more types of ecosystems. Wetlands serve to filter water, control storm surge,
        and provide unique habitat to a variety of different waterbirds, fish, reptiles, amphibians,
        and mammals.
    - name: Biological water
      amount: 0.94
      variance: 30.0
      description: |
        Biological water is the water that is present in all living things. For example,
        you, the reader, are composed of around 70% water. Water is essential for biological
        processes, and is taken in and released by all lifeforms all the time. You drink water
        emit water as waste, and breathe water out of your lungs. Trees take in water for
        their biological processes, and release it in a process known as transpiration.
    - name: Saline lakes
      amount: 95.0
      variance: 10.0
      description: |
        Saline lakes, as their name would suggest, are saltwater lakes on the Earth's land
        surface. Saline lakes and their associated wetlands, while not immediately useful
        to people for drinking water and agriculture, serve as important habitat for migratory
        birds, and serve much of the other uses as freshwater lakes. Notably, most saline lakes
        do not have rivers that flow out of them to the ocean, causing salty minerals to accumulate
        in them as water evaporates out.
    - name: Soil moisture
      amount: 54.0
      variance: 90.0
      description: |
        Soil moisture is the primary source of water for plants, which uptake the water
        through their roots. The moisture content of soil, as well as its permeability,
        or ability to let water in, affect the amount of rainfall that will be absorbed
        by the soil instead of running off. Impermeable soils have high amounts of runoff,
        and can contribute to flooding. Because soil moisture is so important for plants,
        people often raise it artificially via irrigation in order to grow crops.
    - name: Renewable groundwater
      amount: 630.0
      variance: 70.0
      description: &groundwater_description |
        Groundwater is water found underground in the soil, sand, and rock. It accounts for
        around 30% of the Earth's freshwater. People use groundwater for drinking and agriculture
        in many regions, drawing it from aquifers with wells and pumps. If you drink well water,
        you are drinking groundwater. Groundwater is often some of the purest and cleanest water
        available, if it hasn't been disturbed by other human activities. Groundwater is re-filled
        via groundwater recharge, as water that has infiltrated into the soil percolates deeper.
        Not all groundwater can be recharged, and the rate of recharge is often slower than the
        rate at which it is consumed. Groundwater that is recharging far slower than the rate that
        it is used is considered non-renewable.
    - name: Non-renewable groundwater

    - name: Ocean evaporation
      amount: 420.0
      variance: 20.0
      sources:
        - Surface ocean
      destinations:
        - Atmosphere over ocean
      description: |
        Oceanic evaporation occurs when water changes phase from liquid to
        water vapor at the ocean's surface. This change is primarily driven
        by thermal energy delivered to the ocean's surface by the sun. Ocean
        evaporation is the primary influx of water into the Earth's atmosphere,
        and is a big factor in coastal weather patterns.
    - name: Ocean precipitation
      amount: 380.0
      variance: 20.0
      sources:
        - Atmosphere over ocean
      destinations:
        - Surface ocean
      description: |
        Most of the precipitation that falls on Earth falls over the ocean.
        Ocean precipitation accounts for over three quarters of all precipitation
        on earth. Precipitation plays a role in determining the salinity, or saltiness,
        of the ocean's surface.
    - name: Vertical ocean circulation
      amount: 2100.0
      variance: 30.0
      sources:
        - Surface ocean
        - Deep ocean
      destinations:
        - Surface ocean
        - Deep ocean
      description: |
        The flow of water between the ocean's surface to its deeper reaches is called
        vertical ocean circulation. Vertical circulation is primarily driven by
        differences in water density, caused by differences in temperature and salinity.
        Denser water will sink, while less dense water will rise. Vertical ocean circulation
        is part of the global system of thermohaline circulation - sometimes called the ocean
        conveyor belt.
    - name: Ocean to land atmospheric flux
      amount: 46.0
      variance: 20.0
      sources:
        - Atmosphere over ocean
      destinations:
        - Atmosphere over land
      description: |
        Atmospheric water moving over the land from over the ocean is the primary source
        for all precipitation over land, worldwide. Tall mountain ranges can inhibit this 
        movement, creating areas with very low moisture, like the Atacama desert in South
        America.
    - name: Land ice discharge
      amount: 3.1
      variance: 40.0
      sources:
        - Ice sheets and glaciers
      destinations:
        - Surface ocean
      description: |
        As ice sheets and glaciers melt, they mostly release water into the ocean. This
        is speculated to be one of the leading factors in sea level rise. Melting ice sheets
        increase the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth, instead of reflected.
        The influx of cold freshwater into the ocean also has an effect on ocean currents.
    - name: Interbasin ocean circulation
      amount: 5000.0
      variance: 20.0
      sources:
        - Surface ocean
      destinations:
        - Surface ocean
      self_reference: true
      description: |
        Interbasin ocean circulation is another component of the ocean's currents. In particular,
        the term describes the movement of water between ocean basins, which people commonly
        call "seas" or "oceans."
    - name: River discharge to ocean
      amount: 46.0
      variance: 10.0
      sources:
        - Rivers
      destinations:
        - Surface ocean
      description: |
        Most rivers terminate at the ocean, getting broader and slower as they head towards it.
        River deltas and estuaries form at the interface between rivers and oceans, and provide
        unique brackish water ecosystems. Fish like salmon live in pretty much every ecosystem
        along a river's path during their life cycle. Dams and changes in rainfall
        can stop rivers from reaching the ocean, or cause their water levels to drop drastically.
    - name: Groundwater discharge to ocean
      amount: 4.5
      variance: 70.0
      sources:
        - Renewable groundwater
        - Non-renewable groundwater
      destinations:
        - Surface ocean
      description: |
        Groundwater, which flows underground much like rivers flow on the surface, can also make
        its way to the ocean. This flux of water is one of the least well-understood, due to the
        difficulty in measurements and the absolutely immense size of the interface between the
        continental surfaces and the Earth's oceans.
    - name: Land precipitation
      amount: 110.0
      variance: 10.0

        - Reservoirs
      description: |
        Precipitation over the land's surface accounts for about a quarter of all
        precipitation that falls on Earth. Precipitation can take the form of rain,
        sleet, snow, or hail, primarily. Rainfall provides water for rivers, lakes,
        the soil, and people that capture it for later use. Precipitation is determined
        by the topology of the Earth's surface: tall mountains can impede the flow of
        moisture-laden air from the ocean to the land, creating deserts.

        - Biological water
      description: |
        Green water use refers to the water that plants and crops take up out of the soil.
        Green water refers to water that has fallen from rain or entered the soil
        via other natural means, while blue water refers to water used for irrigation.
    - name: Land evapotranspiration

      destinations:
        - Atmosphere over land
      description: |
        Evapotranspiration is the name given to the combined process by which
        water moves from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. It is the combination
        of evaporation, where liquid water on the Earth's surface becomes water vapor,
        and transpiration, where living plants "exhale" water into the air.
    - name: Groundwater recharge
      amount: 13.0
      variance: 50.0
      sources:
        - Soil moisture
      destinations:
        - Renewable groundwater
      description: |
        Groundwater can be recharged as water percolates from top-level soils
        deeper into the soils, sands, and rock below. In doing so, the water is
        filtered, becoming very clean and drinkable, barring external pollution
        and bacteria.

      description: |
        Blue water use is the name given to water used by humans that comes from
        surface water like lakes and rivers, or from aquifers (groundwater). This
        water usage is often characterized by irrigation for crop production, or
        providing drinking water.
